SWUN (Simple softWare Update Notifier) 
is a simple update notifier intended for the use with Slackware Linux.

Swun is a very simple Update notifier, which places itself as an an 
icon into the notification area of the desktop environments.
It does not more than check changes in the changelog 
-This is essentially what "slackpkg check-updates" does-
and changes the icon color accordingly:
red == update available,
green == system is up to date(no changes to the changelog)

Right Click-> There are only 4 Menu Actions:
- Check ChangeLog
 (this is the action, that is automatically triggered from time to time, 
  but you are able to trigger it here)
- CheckUpdateState
  this will do a "Check Changelog" and afterwards check, if all packages
  listed in the cache are really installed(slackpkg upgrade, but no install). 
  if not, it will display these items(root rights required).
- Update System
  This will open a terminal with root rights to give you the chance 
  to run an interactive update(slackpkg upgrade). 
- Quit is self explaining ;-)

Have Fun!


Note on root rights:
You can also add slackpkg tool as a sudo command:
# enable sudo package management without passwords questions like in this line:
$(user)  ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/slackpkg
And set the "USE_SUDO" variable in swun.sh to "yes".
