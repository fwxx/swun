**Swun** is a very simple Update notifier
intended for the use with Slackware Linux.
Swun places itself as an an icon into
the notification area of desktop environments.

Releases are available as
  * Source Package
  * Slackware64 package
As the Source Package contains a `SlackBuild` Script,
it should be easy to create packages for x86
and probably some other versions of Slackware.

Tip:

**You need to have a running slackpkg configuration.** Have a look at the manpage: `man swun`
